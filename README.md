# Matlab-Runge-Kutta-ORDER-FOUR-METHOD
Write a MATLAB code to solve the initial value problem y'=e^(t-y) where  0&lt;=t  &lt;=1 . with initial condition y(0)=1  Runge-Kutta ORDER FOUR METHOD  In each method, N=5,10,20,40,80,160,320,640,1280,2560.  Program must be able to display the error (EN) at the final step t=1 for each N and calculate the ratio of errors The exact solution for this problem is y(t)=ln(e^t + e - 1)
